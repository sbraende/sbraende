## Frontend Developer | Visual-Effects Veteran | Fairly nerdy | ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´
My names is Sebastian BrÃ¦nde, and I'm a frontend developer with a passion for building engaging web experiences. Previously, I worked as a Lighting Department Lead, Visual Effects Supervisor, and Senior Visual Effects Artist for commercials, TV, and film. I hold a bachelor's degree in Animation and a master's degree in Visual Effects, and I love bringing stories to life through visuals.
